# Support
First, please check that your question is not already answered in the [FAQ](FAQ.md). 
Then please address your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/advice?) or directly through GitHub.
If you don't get an answer to your question, you may take technical support from ``` xboxmusicdevapi@microsoft.com```. 

If your project does not fall under our current Terms of Use (including but not limited to commercial use, making Groove Music services accessible on a new device, creating a game or syncing the music with other media), please contact us to enter into a business conversation at  ```groovepartners [@] microsoft.com```. 

## Data to provide
When contacting the API team, please make sure you provide enough data to allow us to efficiently troubleshoot your problem.

If your problem involves a specific API request, please send us a [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) trace containing the request and response.

If for some reason you cannot provide such a trace, please include the request and response details. You should at least include the response "MS-CV" header value and the timestamp of the issue (in UTC time).
